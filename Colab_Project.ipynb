        "\n",
        "If you have plotted some graphs and compared a few countries, you have already noticed that the growing population is not a really influential factor in the emissions of CO2. The best example possible is to plot a graph with *Germany*, *Bulgaria* and *Zambia*:\n",
        "\n",
        "You can see for *Bulgaria* when the population number and the CO2 emissions stay close to each other across time, the simple observation could be to say that population is the main influence in CO2 Emissions... but observe the plots for *Germany* and *Zambia*: you can see that *Germany's* emissions still decrease but its population grows, and for *Zambia* it's more remarkable because the CO2 emissions stay the same but the population grows across time...\n",
        "\n",
        "So you can observe this for every country in the world, the main factor in CO2 emissions is not the population but maybe the laws and how the governments fight against it.\n",

        "### Generation and Consumption Electricity\n",
        "\n",
        "For electricity data analysis, we examine both generation and consumption patterns across different countries and their correlation with population and economic development. Some countries like *France* show interesting patterns where electricity generation doesn't increase even as population and consumption rise. This suggests there is a strong correlation between consumption and population growth, but not necessarily between population and electricity generation.\n",
